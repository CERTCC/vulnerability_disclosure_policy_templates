# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Templates for Receivers

Reporters SHOULD expect ORGANIZATION to do the following.

## General

* ORGANIZATION MAY may modify the terms of this policy or terminate the policy at any time.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL use information reported to this program for defensive purposes only; to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks or applications, or the applications of our vendors.

## Case handling

* ORGANIZATION MAY, at our discretion, decline to coordinate or publish a vulnerability report. This decision is generally based on the scope and severity of the vulnerability and our ability to add value to the coordination and disclosure process.

* In the event that ORGANIZATION declines to coordinate a vulnerability report, the Reporter SHOULD proceed to coordinate with any other affected vendor(s). Additionally, the Reporter MAY proceed with public disclosure at their discretion.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL investigate every reported vulnerability and strive to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate risk and remediate reported vulnerabilities.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL, to the best of our ability, validate the existence of the vulnerability

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL determine an appropriate timeframe for mitigation development and deployment for vulnerabilities reported in systems it controls.


## Coordination with reporters

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports via email within SLC.

*	ORGANIZATION MAY contact the Reporter for further information.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL inform the Reporter of the results of our validation, as appropriate, and accordingly provide status updates as remediation of the vulnerability is underway.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL include credit to the reporter in any published vulnerability report unless otherwise requested by the reporter.

*	In the event that ORGANIZATION chooses to publicly disclose the reported vulnerability, ORGANIZATION SHALL recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change.

*	ORGANIZATION MAY forward the name and contact information of the Reporter to any affected vendors unless otherwise requested by the reporter.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL forward the name and contact information of the reporter to the affected vendors unless otherwise requested by the reporter.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL advise the reporter of significant changes in the status of any vulnerability he or she reported to the extent possible without revealing information provided to us in confidence.

* ORGANIZATION MAY adjust its publication timeframe to accommodate reporter constraints if that timing is otherwise compatible with this policy. In most cases such an adjustment would be expected to represent a delay rather than an acceleration of the publication schedule. Examples include delaying publication to coincide with conference presentations.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL NOT require Reporters to enter into a customer relationship, non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or any other contractual or financial obligation as a condition of receiving or coordinating vulnerability reports.

## Coordination with vendors

*	In the event that ORGANIZATION determines the reported vulnerability is consequent to a vulnerability in a generally available product or service, ORGANIZATION MAY report the vulnerability to the affected vendor(s), service provider(s), or third party vulnerability coordination service(s) in order to enable the product or service to be fixed.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL make a good faith effort to inform vendors of reported vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL forward vulnerability reports to the affected vendor(s) as soon as practical after we receive the report.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL apprise any affected vendors of our publication plans and negotiate alternate publication schedules with the affected vendors when required.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL provide the vendor the opportunity to include a vendor statement within our public disclosure document.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL NOT withhold vendor-supplied information simply because it disagrees with our assessment of the problem.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL notify affected vendors of any public disclosure plans.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL NOT reveal information provided in confidence by any vendor.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL act in accordance with the expectations of Reporters set forth in this policy when acting as a Reporter to other organizations (vendors, coordinators, etc.).


## Coordination with others

* ORGANIZATION MAY engage the services of a third party coordination service (e.g., CERT/CC, DHS CISA) to assist in resolving any conflicts that cannot be resolved between the Reporter and ORGANIZATION.

* ORGANIZATION MAY, at our discretion, provide reported vulnerability information to anyone who can contribute to the solution and with whom we have a trusted relationship, including vendors (often including vendors whose products are not vulnerable), service providers, community experts, sponsors, and sites that are part of a national critical infrastructure, if we believe those sites to be at risk.


## Public disclosure

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL determine the type and schedule of our public disclosure of the vulnerability.

* ORGANIZATION MAY disclose reported vulnerabilities reported to the public N days after the initial report, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or workarounds from affected vendors.

* ORGANIZATION MAY disclose vulnerabilities to the public earlier or later than N days due to extenuating circumstances, including but not limited to active exploitation, threats of an especially serious (or trivial) nature, or situations that require changes to an established standard.

*	ORGANIZATION MAY consult with the Reporter and any affected vendor(s) to determine the appropriate public disclosure timing and details.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL balance the need of the public to be informed of security vulnerabilities with vendors' need for time to respond effectively.

* ORGANIZATION's final determination of a publication schedule SHALL be based on the best interests of the community overall.

* ORGANIZATION SHALL publish public disclosures via PUBLICATION CHANNEL.

*	ORGANIZATION MAY disclose to the public the prior existence of vulnerabilities already fixed by ORGANIZATION, including potentially details of the vulnerability, indicators of vulnerability, or the nature (but not content) of information rendered available by the vulnerability.

*	ORGANIZATION SHALL make our disclosure determinations based on relevant factors such as but not limited to: whether the vulnerability has already been publicly disclosed, the severity of the vulnerability, potential impact to critical infrastructure, possible threat to public health and safety, immediate mitigations available, vendor responsiveness and feasibility for creating an upgrade or patch, and vendor estimate of time required for customers to obtain, test, and apply the patch. Active exploitation, threats of an especially serious nature, or situations that require changes to an established standard may result in earlier or later disclosure.

* ORGANIZATION MAY disclose product vulnerabilities SLC after the initial contact is made, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or workarounds from affected vendors in cases where a product is affected and the vendor is unresponsive, or fails to establish a reasonable timeframe for remediation.
